## Blogging: Documenting the Student Journey

**Problem:** There is a lack of easily accessible resources for students to record and document their educational journey in real time. Current apps that exist are either too simplistic, don't allow effective user experience or lack straightforward support systems that promote and encourage students to engage more in the process.

**Solution Statement:** An app for students of all ages to document their educational journey so that they can look back on and reflect their accomplishments over the years. 

**Product Definition:** BlogApp is an app designed for students to document their academic journey in one unique platform. It allows for customization and personalization of user profiles, posts, and comments. It provides a scaffolded structure that allows users to develop their writing, reflecting, and research skills. It also provides guidance and support to the users through their blogging journey. 

**Target Audience:** BlogApp is intended for students in all grade levels, K-12 and beyond, who are looking for help in documenting their educational journey. 

**Market Size:** There are approximately 314 million students (K-12 & Beyond) globally that would be potential users of BlogApp. 

**Competitive Advantage:** BlogApp offers a platform that is easy-to-use with an intuitive UI/UX design, built for students. We also provide scaffolded support and guidance to our users as they document and reflect on their academic journey. 

## Roadmap

- Development of user interface/design 
- Integrate login authentication

## Business & Revenue Model 

BlogApp will offer both free & premium subscription options. The free option allows for basic documentations while the premium option offers more features for a fee. Other sources of revenue will include in-app purchases, third-party ads, and sponsorships. 

## Go-to-Market Strategy

BlogApp intends to use a three-pronged approach to go-to-market. First, we will begin to reach out to schools and educational institutions, networking with teachers and administrators to have them introduce our platform. Second, we will reach out to student bloggers through social platforms such as Instagram, YouTube, and Twitter to show them the potential and value of BlogApp. Lastly, we will also invest in digital marketing efforts through search-engine optimization (SEO) and Google Ads to reach our target audiences. 

## Ask
