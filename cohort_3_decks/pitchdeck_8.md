RecipeRevive 

## Problem
Cooking has always been an enjoyable activity for many, but it can often be time consuming and tedious, especially with recipes that are complex or unfamiliar. Furthermore, it is difficult for home cooks to keep track of recipes or tweak dishes to be more nutritious. 

## Solution Statement
RecipeRevive is a personalized cooking assistant that helps to boost confidence in the kitchen and make cooking more enjoyable. We make it convenient for users to find and save recipes, discover consistent, creative and nutritious dishes, and customize recipes to fit their needs.

## Product Definition
RecipeRevive is an online platform that enables users to save and access recipes, filter recipes by dietary preferences and ingredients, and personally customize and adapt recipes to suit their diet and nutritional needs. Users can access and browse recipes from a wide range of international cuisines, supermarket ingredients, seasonal foods and creative culinary trends. Through an interactive dashboard, users get recommendations tailored to their individual requirements, and can track their cooking journey as they advance towards the dishes they love. 

## Target Audience
Our target audience includes passionate home cooks of all ages, health-conscious cooks, and food enthusiasts looking to become more creative in the kitchen. 

## Potential Market Size
Potential customers include the general population, as well as professional chefs, health coaches, and nutritionists looking to enhance their cooking skills. We estimate our total addressable market to include over 50 million US-based households. 

## Potential Competitive Advantage
We will be ahead of the competition in providing users with greater control in customizing recipes to meet their nutritional needs, and by creating an interactive and intuitive platform that enables users to discover, store and share recipes ensuring ease of access. 

## Roadmap
Our roadmap will include building a mobile-first responsive website and launching an iOS and Android app. This will involve establishing efficient systems for recipe suggestions tailored to user needs, creating a dashboard for tracking user progress and performance, and developing an algorithm to offer unique recipe recommendations. 

## Business Model
We will generate revenue through a subscription model, in which users can choose to access additional features, such as recipe modifications, grocery list reminders, and meal planners. Additionally, we will partner with supermarkets and grocery stores to provide users with offers and entitlements when purchasing ingredients recommended in recipes. 

## Go to Market Strategy
We plan to use content marketing campaigns to reach our target audience using various digital media channels such as blog posts, social media and newsletters. We will also use online influencers to support our campaigns and leverage partnerships with nutritionists, chefs, and food bloggers to boost our efforts.
