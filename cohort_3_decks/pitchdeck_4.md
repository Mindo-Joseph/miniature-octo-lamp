## HealthDrive 
HealthDrive is a platform for connecting volunteer health workers, individuals who need medical help, and those who seek to contribute to the health-care system. It is designed to increase access to medical care and resources by providing an efficient platform to coordinate volunteer health workers between hospitals, healthcare facilities and individuals.

### Problem 
The current health-care system in many cases does not have the resources to serve more patients and there is an increasing demand in healthcare for volunteering services. This causes increased wait times, lack of information, and a strain on medical resources.

### Solution Statement 
HealthDrive offers an innovative solution for connecting individuals, healthcare facilities, and volunteer health workers in order to increase access to medical care and resources. 

### Product Definition 
HealthDrive is a web-based application which enables volunteers to find medical opportunities, connect with hospitals or healthcare facilities, and manage personal schedules. Through a simple sign-up process, volunteers can search for local medical opportunities, sign up for shifts, and track hours. HealthDrive also offers a secure messaging portal which allows individuals to communicate with hospitals or healthcare facilities in order to arrange for medical care. 

### Target Audience 
The target audience includes health-care facilities, individuals, and volunteer health workers. Specifically, our platform would benefit hospitals and healthcare institutions by providing qualified and motivated individuals, while individuals would benefit by having access to healthcare when needed. In addition, volunteer health workers are able to gain valuable experience and knowledge which can assist in pursuing a medical career. 

### Potential Market Size 
Our potential market size is vast, as HealthDrive can serve any location with a need for medical services and access to volunteers. In addition, the application is designed to serve individuals of all ages, from infants to the elderly. As such, our platform could potentially reach a population of over 7.5 billion people.

### Competitive Advantage 
HealthDriveâ€™s competitive advantage lies in its ability to quickly coordinate volunteer health workers and ensure that individuals have access to proper medical care. HealthDrive is designed with the user in mind and provides a secure method for connecting and communicating with others. Additionally, our platform is designed to track and manage volunteer hours, making it easier for users to monitor their involvement in the healthcare sector 

### Roadmap 
The roadmap for HealthDrive includes four key milestones:

1. Design and develop the web-based application
2. Integrate additional features such as scheduling and tracking of volunteer hours
3. Beta testing to ensure platform security and stability
4. Launch the application and begin marketing and promotion
 
### Business Model 
HealthDrive will principally generate revenue through premium subscriptions and/or advertisements. We plan to offer a free basic version of the web-based application and then charge a monthly subscription fee for advanced features. In addition, we will explore implementing advertisements on the platform in order to generate additional revenue. 

### Go-to-Market Strategy 
HealthDrive plans to utilize a multi-channel go-to-market strategy which includes both direct and digital marketing. We plan to target local hospitals and healthcare facilities via direct marketing and establish partnerships for mutual benefit. Additionally, we plan to utilize various digital marketing techniques such as search engine optimization, social media advertising, email marketing, and content marketing. 

### Ask 
We are seeking initial funding to support the development and launch of the HealthDrive application. This initial funding will be used to cover the cost of engineering, marketing, and operations. In exchange for funding, we are offering equity and/or revenue sharing.
