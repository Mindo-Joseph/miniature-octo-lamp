## AgriTech Connect: Leveraging Digital Technology to Increase Smallholder Farmer Productivity
Problem: Smallholder farmers play a pivotal role in global agriculture production, having a major impact on economic growth and nutrition across the globe. However, they face significant challenges due to the unreliable supply of goods and limited access to resources and markets.

Solution: AgriTech Connect is a digital platform that aims to provide a tailored suite of inputs, services, and resources to rural and smallholder farmers. Our service allows for an easy and cost effective connection to trusted, reliable suppliers, saving time and money for all parties involved. 

Product Definition: AgriTech Connect is an online platform that provides farmers access to the essential components required for food production. Farmers will be able to access a wide array of services, inputs, and resources such as agricultural technologies, market-related information, quality land surveys, business credit, agricultural supplies, etc. 

Target Audience:  Smallholder farmers in low-income countries especially in Africa and Southern Asia are the primary target audience. 

Market Size: The global market size of AgriTech is estimated to hit USD 600 Billion by 2024.

Competitive Advantage: Our competitive advantage is that we are extremely customer focused, bridging the gap between smallholder farmers and local suppliers and international investors. This ensures that farmers have access to necessary inputs, resources, and reliable suppliers. AgriTech Connect provides a transparent system so farmers can make informed decisions. 

Roadmap:
- Secure funding and finalize our legal structure
- Build platform and accompanying mobile app for farmers
- Connect with local suppliers, regional partners, and international experts to design tailor-made packages
- Ensure access to key services such as financial institutions and sustainable alternatives
- Launch educational campaigns

Business and Revenue Model: AgriTech Connect will generate revenue through a subscription model based on the services provided and percentage commissions on sales. The subscription model itself will include e-commerce platforms, tailored packages/services, customized support services and regional & international experts.

Go-To-Market Strategy: We will initially target countries that have recently seen growth in agricultural production, such as Kenya, India, and Nigeria. Through partnerships with local universities and government entities, we will gain access to resources and potential customers. We will focus our marketing and advertisement tactics on utilizing online and offline channels, such as TV, radio, web partnerships, and grassroots campaigns.

The Ask: We are seeking USD 3 million in capital to cover the initial cost of building our platform, connecting with regional partners, and launching our go-to-market strategy. We are confident that AgriTech Connect will be a successful product that can provide rural and smallholder farmers the tools and support they need to increase their productivity.
