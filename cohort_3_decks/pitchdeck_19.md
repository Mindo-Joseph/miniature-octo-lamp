##  WeatherSense: An Intuitive Weather Forecasting App
 
### Problem 
The rise of digital technology has significantly advanced the development of weather forecasting tools and access to such data is more convenient than ever before. However, most existing weather forecast applications are unintuitive, complicated to use, and lack the ability to present data in an intuitive format or customizable manner.

### Solution 
WeatherSense is a simple and intuitive weather forecasting application designed to make it easy for users to check their local weather information with ease. Our application integrates with an API to bring detailed weather data straight to user devices. An intuitive and easily understood UI make it easy even for the most tech-challenged individuals to stay one step ahead of the weather. 

### Product Definition
WeatherSense is a web and mobile application that provides an intuitive way of retrieving up-to-date forecast information from a user's local area. Users have the ability to customize temperature, wind speed, and other information through drop-downs and selectively-displayed items. Future functionality will include extended weather recaps, wind direction prediction, and up to date weather advisories.

### Target Audience
WeatherSense targets those who need access to accurate and convenient weather forecasting in their local area. This includes casual users such as everyday individuals, commuters, and outdoor enthusiasts, as well as organizations such as canoe and kayak clubs, ski resorts, and outdoor retailers.

### Market Size
The market size for this product is estimated to be 15 million users in the US alone. There is also a worldwide market of 1.5 billion users, many of whom are in developing countries that do not have access to advanced weather forecasting tools.

### Competitive Advantage 
WeatherSenseâ€™s competitive advantage lies in its intuitive interface and customizable features. We offer a comprehensive way of viewing weather data for any region of the world, while remaining user friendly and accessible. Our program also includes a feature which allows users to save their forecasts, making the app more versatile and more convenient than any existing weather app. 

### Roadmap
The road map for WeatherSense is simple. We will begin by releasing the initial version of the website and application with basic functionality. This will include an easy-to-understand interface, access to detailed weather information, and the ability to customize the data based on user preferences. We plan to introduce additional features over the next 6 to 12 months, including extended weather recaps, wind direction prediction, and up to date weather advisories.

### Business Model and Revenue
We plan to make WeatherSense a freemium application. We will offer basic functionality to all users for free and charge a fee for more advanced features such as wind direction prediction and extended weather recaps. Additionally, we will charge a fee to industry partners such as ski resorts, outdoor retailers, and canoe and kayak clubs for access to detailed weather data for their local area. 

### Go-To-Market Strategy 
The go-to-market strategy for WeatherSense is multifaceted. We plan to leverage our existing connections within the outdoor industry, as well as social media channels including Reddit and Instagram to reach our target market. Additionally, we plan to offer public relations campaigns to generate press coverage and website articles, as well as targeted email campaigns to gain new users. 

### Ask
We are looking to raise $500,000 in seed funding to complete the development of WeatherSense and launch our mobile application. This money will be used to develop the features and interface of the app, populate the application with weather data, and develop our comprehensive go-to-market strategy.
