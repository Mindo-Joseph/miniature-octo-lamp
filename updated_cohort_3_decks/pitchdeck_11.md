## Title: ImpactReach

## Problem
Many people want to engage in meaningful, sustainable philanthropic efforts, but have difficulty selecting a charity that aligns with their values and causes. As a result, donations may be randomly selected, without any research as to the efficacy and reach of the organization.

## Solution Statement
ImpactReach is a revolutionary app that connects users with charities aligned with their values, allowing them to make informed and meaningful contributions. As an all-in-one platform for friendly competition and charitable support, ImpactReach is a game-changer in the field of charitable giving.

## Product Definition
ImpactReach is an app that allows users to find, compare, and donate to charities that align with their individual values. ImpactReach will curate meaningful content to educate users about charities and their causes, allowing them to make informed decisions concerning donations. The app will feature interactive elements that facilitate friendly competition and leaderboards for donations, allowing users to track their impact.

## Target Audience 
ImpactReach is aimed at anyone who wants to get involved in philanthropy, providing them with an easy and engaging app to track the do-good activities of friends and family. Through a highly accessible interface, novices and experienced givers alike can find and donate to exemplary charities.

## Potential Market Size
According to Giving USA, average charitable giving in the U.S. in 2019 totaled $427.71 billion, suggesting that ImpactReach has the potential to capture a significant share of the annual donations market.

The proposed competitive advantage not only stands to increase user engagement but also inspire higher levels of giving as users recognize the direct impact of their donations.

## Roadmap
The proposed ImpactReach roadmap begins with creating a core team of developers and content curators for the app. The first step is to create the product roadmap, which includes designing and developing the component parts of the app. In turn, this roadmap will be used to create and implement the product backlog for code development and content curation. The next step will be to move into beta testing and collect user feedback which can be used to refine and improve the app. The product launch will follow, during which marketing and advertising campaigns will be exercised to maximize initial user uptake. Finally, post-launch customer support processes will be set up to ensure continued user satisfaction and continued growth of the ImpactReach community.

## Business & Revenue Model 
ImpactReach plans to offer a freemium model, so users can access its basic feature set for free. It also plans to offer add-on packages and advanced features for users willing to pay for premium access, which will generate income for the firm. ImpactReach also plans to generate revenue through the selling of ads and sponsorships and also through transaction fees from users donations.
